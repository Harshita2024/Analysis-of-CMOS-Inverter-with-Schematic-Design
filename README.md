 # Introduction
 Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) technology forms the foundation of modern VLSI systems. By combining pMOS and nMOS transistors in a complementary arrangement, CMOS circuits achieve low static       power dissipation, high noise margins, and scalability to nanometer process nodes. This energy efficiency and robustness have made CMOS the dominant choice for digital logic design, processors, and memory         elements in todayâ€™s integrated circuits.<br>
The CMOS inverter, being the most fundamental logic element, plays a crucial role in digital design. Its schematic consists of a pMOS connected to the supply voltage and an nMOS connected to ground, sharing a     common output node. This simple yet powerful configuration serves as the basis for implementing all other logic functions, making it an ideal circuit for performance evaluation and characterization.<br>
From a VLSI perspective, the CMOS inverter is often treated as a benchmark cell to extract key performance parameters that influence the design of larger and more complex circuits. In this project, we have performed a detailed study involving DC analysis, transient analysis, propagation delay measurement, evaluation of output capacitance effects, and calculation of power dissipation components. These analyses provide valuable insights into circuit behavior, enabling optimization for speed, power, and area in advanced VLSI designs.
